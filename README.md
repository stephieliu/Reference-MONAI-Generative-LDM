# Reference-MONAI-Generative-LDM

This repository contains a sample latent diffusion model following the tutorial from Project MONAI Generative Models. The code found in this repository was used for personal educational purposes to develop an basic understanding of LDMs.

Minor modifications were made (i.e. optimizing parameters).

The original Generative Model tutorial can be found here: https://github.com/Project-MONAI/GenerativeModels/blob/main/tutorials/generative/3d_ldm/3d_ldm_tutorial.ipynb
